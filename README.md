# 📖 Address Book Management System in C

I built this Address Book project using C to practice real-world concepts like file handling, modular programming, and data validation.  
It allows users to **add, search, edit, delete, and save contacts** using a simple command-line interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Add, search, edit, delete, and list contacts  
- Save and load data with file handling  
- Input validation for names, phone, and email  
- Modular structure using separate `.c` and `.h` files  
- Colorful, emoji-based CLI output 💻  

## ⚙️ How to Run
```bash
gcc main.c contact.c file.c populate.c -o address_book
./address_book
